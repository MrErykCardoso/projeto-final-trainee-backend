This is the final project of the DEVOPS trainee project:

My contributions were in the branch "1-feat-criacao-de-conta-e-p" and in the branch in collaboration with ItzTas aka Tales Sabini in pair-programming "login-feat" that is actually merged into the dev branch.
Totally great points for heyitsmepablo aka Pablo Eduardo for all classes so far that made me learn these concepts, and GuilhermeBn198 aka Ghilherme Bernardo for the review in my pull request.
And also Tales Sabini for the specially help while pair-programming.
